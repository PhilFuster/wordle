# Wordle

After working through the 2048 module in Chris Biscardi's [Rust Adventure](https://www.rustadventure.dev) I was inspired to try and implement the popular game, **Wordle**.  

I feel pretty prepared to implement this game after going through the module but, we shall see!  

Unfortunately, I forgot to create the git repository in the beginning and haven't committed anything but better late than never.
